    <h1 style =" color: brown;"> The Brown Bear </h1>
    <P style="color: blue; font-style: inherit;"> The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear native to Eurasia and North America.
        It is one of the largest land carnivorans, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, 
        the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. 
        The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more 
        compactly built than females. The pelage ranges from reddish to yellowish-brown,
        and dark brown to cream in color. It evolved large hump muscles, unique among bears,
        and wide 21 to 36 cm (8.3 to 14.2 in) long paws to effectively dig through dirt.
        Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its dietary plasticity.</P>
